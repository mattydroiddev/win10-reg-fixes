# win10-reg-fixes
Win10 registry quick fixes. These are quick fix click and run registry entries for some of the more common annoyances I run into in Windows 10.
Registry files like these (.reg) can be viewed as plain text in Notepad etc. If you are curious about what exactly one does, always view it first.

If you don't know what any of these are, you don't need them.
